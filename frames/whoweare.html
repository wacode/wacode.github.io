They placed first in two of them and second in the other. The club focuses on developing practical programming skills for competitions.</p>
<p>Meetings are held once a week in the programming lab (Mrs. Trehan's room). Anyone interested in joining is welcome to attend. All levels of experience are welcome.</p>
