<p>The online judge is a tool for members of the Westford Academy Programming Team to test their solutions to competition problems. It provides near instantaneous feedback, and tests each program with a variety of test cases. Please respect the <a href="rules.html">Rules of the Online Judge</a>.</p>
<p>To view the judge's code or to report problems, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/colavitam/Online-Judge" target="_blank">project page</a>.</p>
